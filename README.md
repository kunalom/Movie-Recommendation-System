# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview:-
This project is a movie recommendation system built using data from TMDB (The Movie Database) for 5000 movies. The goal of this system is to recommend movies based on a given movie title using a combination of data cleaning, feature engineering, and word vectorization with cosine similarity.

## Features:-
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering
3. Word Vectorization
4. Cosine Similarity for Recommendations

## Dataset
The dataset consists of information on 5000 movies from TMDB, including titles, genres, overview, cast, crew, and more.

## Requirements:-
  *Python 3.x
  *NumPy
  *Pandas
  *Scikit-learn
  *NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Results:-
Given the movie title "The Dark Knight", the system will recommend movies with similar characteristics based on the cosine similarity of their feature vectors.

## Contributing:-
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for improvements or bug fixes.

## Acknowledgements:-
